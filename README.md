## Bootcamp Challenge Assignment - Module 01

The challenge for Module 1 was to refactor source code for accessibility. Optimization of the page's title, markup structure, and alt tags are vital to boosting the page's search engine presence, as well as enhancing the experience for users with screen readers. Changes have been made to the original files to meet these goals.

Page markup and CSS also required small adjustments for easier readability and more efficient organization of the stylesheet.
